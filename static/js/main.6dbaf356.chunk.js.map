For ex, if their name was John Smith, they put Sohn Jmith and that error was subsequently included in the MSPE!!!\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </Story>\r\n                <Story>\r\n                    <p>Someone on the street said “hi Ching Chong!” and pulled his eyelids to the corners when I biked past him</p>\r\n                </Story>\r\n                <Story bolded={'\"Okay... but what are you?\"...when it happens time and time again, it drains and exhausts you.'}>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Multiple patients asked me where I was from. My answer was always the same - \"I'm from here. I was born in Maryland.\" These were some of\r\n                        their responses: \"Oh! Well, I hold nothing against you.\" \"No, but really where are you from? Korea?\" \"Well I'm not trying to offend you\r\n                        or anything.\" \"Okay... but what are you?\"\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        I see a fair amount of what we do in medicine as \"customer service.\" I cannot launch into a conversation about why these\r\n                        microaggressions hurt during a 15 minute visit, especially when the visit is to talk about their diabetes. The AAPI experience is\r\n                        complex and takes time to discuss with someone who has rarely interacted with someone from our community. So, I decide to change the\r\n                        subject and swallow that frustration. But when it happens time and time again, it drains and exhausts you.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </Story>\r\n                <Story bolded=\"told her not to give them covid\">\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        There was a Chinese graduate student who was using the shuttle service (pre shut down) and one of the officers commented on her race and\r\n                        jokingly told her not to give them covid. This is an issue that has been reported and addressed but is still a problem AAPI face during\r\n                        the pandemic.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Also something that keeps happening to me, so many patients asking where I’m from.

We politely\r\n                        ignored him, but the bus driver stepped up and ultimately kicked him off the bus. I appreciated knowing that there were still many\r\n                        people that would not tolerate such behavior, especially during the time when the \"scare\" was just starting. However, it was\r\n                        disheartening for me to see someone that I have no doubt has been judged many times before based on the color of his skin and his\r\n                        disheveled appearance, have such low tolerance for other minorities. While I understand that minorities come from a wide range of\r\n                        background, I myself from the \"model minority,\" while him being part of a minority that has been taken advantage of and disenfranchised\r\n                        for more than a century, my hope is that we can all support and sympathize with the specific causes that each minority group stands for\r\n                        and fights to accomplish to better their communities.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </Story>\r\n                <Story bolded=\"But that’s me.

He joked that “now is not the time to buy that big bag of rice at Costco, if you know what I mean.” I wasn’t sure what he\r\n                        meant. It felt like he was implying that we should be avoiding the type of people who buy the big bags of rice at Costco. But that’s me.\r\n                        That’s my family.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </Story>\r\n                <Story bolded=\"racism/prejudice exists between different asian cultures\">\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        On one of my 3rd year core rotations, the intern I was working with made a forced, off-color joke about Bangladeshi doctors. I was\r\n                        offended by his comment, which basically connotated that doctors of that ethnicity provide sub-par care, especially given my Bengali\r\n                        heritage. I was in a bind in terms of speaking up however because A) I knew this person would be evaluating me and B) That person is\r\n                        also of asian descent. Situations like these bring to light that there isn't just white-on-asian racism but that racism/prejudice exists\r\n                        between different asian cultures - which is equally as bad. Today is the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence (3/26), which\r\n                        made me even more compelled to write about this.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </Story>\r\n                <Story bolded=\"He is the most important person to a (future) physician: my patient.\">\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        “You Chinese - you all just love doing things to people. Doing things you don't even know how to do. You're just trying to hurt me. You\r\n                        people would love to see that, wouldn't you?\" My patient said this to me the day after the Atlanta shootings. He was angry with me and\r\n                        my intern (another woman) because we were removing his central line, and he didn't think we knew what we were doing. My intern, who is\r\n                        very much a Real Doctor with a medical degree, had to show him her badge to prove that she was indeed a physician, and definitely knew\r\n                        what she was doing. He laughed at us. “You’re both lying. I know you’re not doctors.” Then he looked to me, and then he degraded me for\r\n                        the color of my skin. Racism is not new to me. I’ve been called racial slurs, I’ve been greeted with “ching chong, ching chong,” I’ve\r\n                        had people walk up to me and pull on their eyelids.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>But this.</p>\r\n                    <p>This hurt. Deeply.</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        I had been following this patient for 4 days. Every morning I came into his room and I talked to him. I examined him, making sure his\r\n                        heart and lungs sounded ok, making sure his wounds were being cared for. I reassured him when he was nervous about a procedure. I made\r\n                        sure he got his medicine when he was in pain.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        I’d made many phone calls to his wife, who really worried about him. I’d extended my deepest sympathies to him and his family. I’d grown\r\n                        to care deeply for him.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>He is the most important person to a (future) physician: my patient.</p>\r\n                    <p>But what am I to him?

I did not saying anything when my senior resident – a white man – stepped into the room, and the patient\r\n                        exclaimed:\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>“Thank God, someone who can actually help me!”</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        I pretended not to want to cry while I held his hand as we finished the procedure, and I talked to him about his grandkids to distract\r\n                        him.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        I am so, so sad.
