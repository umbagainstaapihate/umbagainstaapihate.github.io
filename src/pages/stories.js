                    <p>
                        I was in my car stopped at an intersection when a middle aged man walked in front of it and began to aggressively yell at me. He
                        repeatedly asked if I was Chinese, and kept referring to me as “fuckin Chinese” (not acknowledging the non-Asian passenger next to me)–
                        he refused to move for a while before he spat on the windshield and left.

                        I was walking the child I was babysitting in his stroller on the harbor, when a man started shouting "You fucking Chinks, stop fucking
                        having kids here." at us from behind. I started walking faster, but he began to follow us, shouting "We're gonna crush you and all your
                        chinky babies." I felt his spit on my arm. I saw two police officers and started running towards them. The man ran away.

                    <p>
                        My mother and sister were standing outside Chelsea Market trying to call an Uber. A young white woman in a group of white teenagers
                        walking by them grabbed my mother's phone out of her hand and started waving it above her head, saying "Come get it, Chinese b*tch." My
                        sister started yelling at her to give the phone back, causing the woman to laugh and drop the phone onto the ground. This happened early
                        in the pandemic, late March of last year, when the market was still busy. According to mom and sister, numerous people witnessed the
                        event and did not intervene or say anything to them after it was over.

                    <p>
                        I was crossing the street when a man walking the opposite direction suddenly turned around and shouted: "Y'all disgusting dogs brought
                        this sh*t here y'all better clean this shit up or get the f*ck out you f*cking bitch." I froze and started staring at him. I started
                        walking towards him but my partner held me back. People on both sides of the street were staring at us, but said nothing. We found the
                        nearest Starbucks and I broke down in the bathroom.

                        Maybe not “outwardly” racist, but the course director spelled my friend's birth name wrong by mixing up the first letters of their first
                        and last name. For ex, if their name was John Smith, they put Sohn Jmith and that error was subsequently included in the MSPE!!!

                    <p>
                        Multiple patients asked me where I was from. My answer was always the same - "I'm from here. I was born in Maryland." These were some of
                        their responses: "Oh! Well, I hold nothing against you." "No, but really where are you from? Korea?" "Well I'm not trying to offend you
                        or anything." "Okay... but what are you?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I see a fair amount of what we do in medicine as "customer service." I cannot launch into a conversation about why these
                        microaggressions hurt during a 15 minute visit, especially when the visit is to talk about their diabetes. The AAPI experience is
                        complex and takes time to discuss with someone who has rarely interacted with someone from our community. So, I decide to change the
                        subject and swallow that frustration. But when it happens time and time again, it drains and exhausts you.

                    <p>
                        There was a Chinese graduate student who was using the shuttle service (pre shut down) and one of the officers commented on her race and
                        jokingly told her not to give them covid. This is an issue that has been reported and addressed but is still a problem AAPI face during
                        the pandemic.

                        Also something that keeps happening to me, so many patients asking where I’m from. And then playing 20 questions when I don’t engage. Or
                        getting offended... like, you’re the one being rude.

                <Story bolded="them asians are coming">
                    <p>
                        At the start of the pandemic (Late March 2020), my significant other and I were on a bus to get lunch when a disheveled male started
                        yelling that "them asians are coming." He wasn't violent, but walked up to us clearly attempting to look intimidating. We politely
                        ignored him, but the bus driver stepped up and ultimately kicked him off the bus. I appreciated knowing that there were still many
                        people that would not tolerate such behavior, especially during the time when the "scare" was just starting. However, it was
                        disheartening for me to see someone that I have no doubt has been judged many times before based on the color of his skin and his
                        disheveled appearance, have such low tolerance for other minorities. While I understand that minorities come from a wide range of
                        background, I myself from the "model minority," while him being part of a minority that has been taken advantage of and disenfranchised
                        for more than a century, my hope is that we can all support and sympathize with the specific causes that each minority group stands for
                        and fights to accomplish to better their communities.

                    <p>
                        At the beginning of the pandemic, the clerkship director was talking to us about preparations we should be making with the situation
                        getting worse. He joked that “now is not the time to buy that big bag of rice at Costco, if you know what I mean.” I wasn’t sure what he
                        meant. It felt like he was implying that we should be avoiding the type of people who buy the big bags of rice at Costco. But that’s me.
                        That’s my family.

                <Story bolded="racism/prejudice exists between different asian cultures">
                    <p>
                        On one of my 3rd year core rotations, the intern I was working with made a forced, off-color joke about Bangladeshi doctors. I was
                        offended by his comment, which basically connotated that doctors of that ethnicity provide sub-par care, especially given my Bengali
                        heritage. I was in a bind in terms of speaking up however because A) I knew this person would be evaluating me and B) That person is
                        also of asian descent. Situations like these bring to light that there isn't just white-on-asian racism but that racism/prejudice exists
                        between different asian cultures - which is equally as bad. Today is the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence (3/26), which
                        made me even more compelled to write about this.

                <Story bolded="He is the most important person to a (future) physician: my patient.">
                    <p>
                        “You Chinese - you all just love doing things to people. Doing things you don't even know how to do. You're just trying to hurt me. You
                        people would love to see that, wouldn't you?" My patient said this to me the day after the Atlanta shootings. He was angry with me and
                        my intern (another woman) because we were removing his central line, and he didn't think we knew what we were doing. My intern, who is
                        very much a Real Doctor with a medical degree, had to show him her badge to prove that she was indeed a physician, and definitely knew
                        what she was doing. He laughed at us. “You’re both lying. I know you’re not doctors.” Then he looked to me, and then he degraded me for
                        the color of my skin. Racism is not new to me. I’ve been called racial slurs, I’ve been greeted with “ching chong, ching chong,” I’ve
                        had people walk up to me and pull on their eyelids.
                    </p>
                    <p>But this.</p>
                    <p>This hurt. Deeply.</p>
                    <p>
                        I had been following this patient for 4 days. Every morning I came into his room and I talked to him. I examined him, making sure his
                        heart and lungs sounded ok, making sure his wounds were being cared for. I reassured him when he was nervous about a procedure. I made
                        sure he got his medicine when he was in pain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’d made many phone calls to his wife, who really worried about him. I’d extended my deepest sympathies to him and his family. I’d grown
                        to care deeply for him.
                    </p>
                    <p>He is the most important person to a (future) physician: my patient.</p>
                    <p>But what am I to him? I am not a person. I am worthless</p>
                    <p>I am a ch*nk – I am foreign and beneath him. I am a woman – I have no authority and I am incapable.</p>
                    <p>I know that is not who I am. I know my qualifications, my competence, my worth.</p>
                    <p>But in that moment, I felt like I was nobody.</p>
                    <p>
                        I sucked it up in the moment. I did not saying anything when my senior resident – a white man – stepped into the room, and the patient
                        exclaimed:
                    </p>
                    <p>“Thank God, someone who can actually help me!”</p>
                    <p>
                        I pretended not to want to cry while I held his hand as we finished the procedure, and I talked to him about his grandkids to distract
                        him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am so, so sad. I love this country. My parents came here for a brighter future for themselves. They wanted to raise a daughter here
                        for exactly that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know that I belong here, even when there are days like that day, weeks like that week, or years like this past year, when it doesn’t
                        feel like this country loves me back.
